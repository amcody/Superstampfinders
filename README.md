# Superstampfinders
This ipython notebook creates cutouts for K2 Mission superstamp images.

Provide an RA and Dec and choose your superstamp (fits files provided). 
Then the notebook will output cutouts from both K2 data and various ground-based
surveys, all with the same scale and rotated to north.
